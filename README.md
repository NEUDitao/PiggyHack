# PiggyHack (aka FeetShare)

This app aims to be the Uber for piggy back rides, allowing people to request
piggy back rides to and from places. This app will revolutionalize the way
people think about transportation. Via this app, those without the ability
to run their cars in the ground for extra cash can now even use their bodies
to not only whip themselves into shape, but also be able to earn extra money
in their free time piggy backing people around the world!

### ALL NEW UNIQUE FEATURES!

Our state-of-the art app uses __algorithms__ to calculate on the
__blockchain__ if a piggyback-ee is the perfect fit for someone. Our advanced
__machine learning__ __artificial intelligence__ uses the __big data__ we
collect on users, and through __quantum computing__, will kick out those who
aren't performing satisfactorily. We guarantee you that the performance of
our app is LEGENDARY, FULLY FUNCTIONAL, and BUG FREE. It was developed by
some of the most functional programmers of the ages!

### ALL FREE!

That's right! Unlike Uber, our service is __FREE__, so you can get a ride
ANYWHERE, without paying a dime. You should try TODAY!
